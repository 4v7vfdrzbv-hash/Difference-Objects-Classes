# Difference-Objects-Classes

A class is like a blueprint or plan used to create objects. It explains what something is and what it can do by listing its variables (called fields) and methods (actions). For example, a Car class might include information like color, speed, and model, along with actions such as drive or brake. A class by itself is not a real thing, it is just the design. An Object is created from a class and represents something real that can be used in a program. When you make an object from the Car class, that object can hold actual values, such as a red car driving at 60 miles per hour. Objects are what store data and perform actions while the program is running.
The main difference between a class and an object is that a class describes, while an object exists. One class can be used to create many objects, and each object can have its own unique values, even though they all follow the same design.
