# Difference-Objects-Classes

In Java, classes and objects are two important ideas that help programmers organize their code. A class can be thought of as a blueprint or plan. It explains what something is and what it can do. A class lists variables, which store information, and methods, which are actions. For example, a Car class might describe things like the car’s color, speed, and model. It may also include actions such as driving or braking. A class by itself is not something you can use right away. It is only a design that tells the program how to create something later.
An object is created from a class and represents a real item in the program. When a program creates an object from the Car class, that object becomes an actual car that the program can use. The object can store real values, such as a red color or a speed of 60 miles per hour. Objects are what actually do the work while the program is running. They use the methods from the class and can change their information as the program runs.
The main difference between a class and an object is that a class describes something, while an object is the real version of that description. A class shows what something should look like and how it should behave. An object follows that design and exists in the program. One class can be used to create many objects. Even though all the objects are created from the same class, each object can have its own values and behave differently. This makes it easier to manage programs, keep code organized, and model real-world things in a simple way.
